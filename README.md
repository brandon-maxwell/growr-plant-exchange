Welcome to Growr, a plant exchange app with the focus of promoting community/local gathering and networking through the love of all things plant related.

With the dependency on mobile apps rooted deep in our behaviors, we want to revitalize what it means to be part of and have the support of a community. Growr acts as a facilitator of "good neighbor vibes" by targeting the all your activities within a set radius - we're in support of face-to-plant interactions, not emoji-to-emoji. :seedling:

Exchanges are just to get you into first gear - trade seeds for clippings, give away some free aloe pups, request some strange succulent to add to the collection - grow not just new plants but also your community and hit up the farmer's market or start a new urban/community garden with your new-to-you neighbors!


### Project Status:

*ONGOING*

#### In progress:
* messenging/inboxing function: currently hardcoded
* authentication: JWT > need to build auth into frontend simultaneously as data starts to get populated/rendered

#### Issues to debug:
* image upload function:
    - `TypeError: cannot read property 'path' of undefined` > req.file.path not defined
    - issue with where we are grabbing image from? multi-type form/data?

### Process:
#### Tasks

*All members of the project are full-stack coders and put work into both sides of developement: these generalized tasks and assignments act as a jumping block to initiate work flow and designate responsibility. See [**Project Members**](#project-members) section for reference.*

    - design UI navigational flow chart for pages/components
    - build skeleton of react-creat-app directory structure

    - image upload and render function
    - messaging/inboxing function

* **BACKEND:** BM / PH / RH
    - design models for mongoose/mongoDB schema and documents
    - design API workflow
    - mock up data to seed database in developement
    - research third party API for location functionality
    - image upload and render function
    - messaging/inboxing function

### Beyond the MVP

* landing page search by zipcode function to render demo page
    - for non-signedup users
    - readme only with any interaction to redirect to signup page
* develope messaging/inbox function into forum based UI
* addition interactions with cards
