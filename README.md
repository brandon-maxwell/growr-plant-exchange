## Project overview

Welcome to Growr, a plant exchange app with the focus of promoting community/local gathering and networking through the love of all things plant related.

With the dependency on mobile apps rooted deep in our behaviors, we want to revitalize what it means to be part of and have the support of a community. Growr acts as a facilitator of "good neighbor vibes" by targeting the all your activities within a set radius - we're in support of face-to-plant interactions, not emoji-to-emoji. :seedling:

Exchanges are just to get you into first gear - trade seeds for clippings, give away some free aloe pups, request some strange succulent to add to the collection - grow not just new plants but also your community and hit up the farmer's market or start a new urban/community garden with your new-to-you neighbors!

### Project Status:

* messenging/inboxing function: currently hardcoded
* authentication: session/connect-mongo vs passport vs JWT
